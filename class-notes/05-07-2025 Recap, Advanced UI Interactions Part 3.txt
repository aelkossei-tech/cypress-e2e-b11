How do we handle the Alerts in Cypress? 

Cypress by default handles the Warning and Confirmation alerts by clicking the "Okay". Cypress does not handle 
the Prompt alert becuase it assumes input must be entered by the user. 

We don't handle Warning and Confirmation alerts, but if we want to interact w/ the dialogs. We have to use 
cy.on() event listener. 

cy.on() => It's an event listener that listens for that specific event that trigered by the browser, and handle it 
if its needed. 

cy.on('window:alert')
cy.on('window:confirm')


How do we handle the Prompt alert in Cypress? 

First, we have to call the prompt method, which is an instance of a windows object JS. After, we need to use 
cy.stub() method that is coming from the Sinon bundled library which will allow us to replace the functionality of original 
prompt method. 

cy.window().then((win) => {
    cy.stub(win, 'prompt').returns('My Input'); 
})


Keyboard and Mouse Actions in Cypress: 

Cypress Keyboard or Mouse actions are simulated which are actually fired from JS. For this reason, while
using any Cypress UI interaction methods, we might end up having errors. 

To fix this issue, it's suggested to install library called "real-event" from npm. This library creates user actions 
using CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) which is pretty much same as real user actions.
