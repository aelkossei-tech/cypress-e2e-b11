RECAP: 

File upload & download: 
    - Locate the file, and click on the download link. After clicking on the download button, assets folder will trigger
      the download directory, and put the downloaded file in it. 
    - Then, we can assert if the download is successful by using cy.readFile() method 
    - cy.readFile('downloads/downloadPath/file.csv)

File Upload: 
    - When we download, we look for web element <input>. Simply, input file will be created with type="file" which indicates 
    that we can upload a file in it. After locating this input
        - cy.get('uploadInput).selecFile('filePath') ==> single file upload 
        - cy.get('uploadInput).selecFile(['filePath', 'path2'], { action: 'drag-drop' }) ==> multiple files upload
