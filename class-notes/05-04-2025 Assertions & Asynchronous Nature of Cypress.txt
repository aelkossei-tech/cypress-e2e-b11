** INTERVIEW QUESTION: Tell me about Cypress assertions. **
    - Assertions ==> how Cypress checks that the app behaves as expected 
    - Default, implicit, explicit assertions 
        - Default ==> many Cypress commands have built-in checks 
      - implicit vs. explicit  --> one has retries and the other DOESN'T (explicit - doesn't wait for 4 secs + .explicit())
        - Implicit ==> these are built into Cypress commands w/ .should() and .and() [retries up tp 4 seconds]
        - Explicit ==> you write these using JS assertion libraries [they DONT wait for anything]
            - .expect()
    - aynchornous Cypress 
    - Give a couple of examples --> EX: .should()
    - Return VS. Yield 
        - cypress will never return any elements --> so that's the reason why you can't store in a vairable (like JS)
